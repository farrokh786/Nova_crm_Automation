## üìÑ How It Works

1. **User enters website URL(s)** when running the script.
2. **Script scrapes** logos, PDFs, and hero/product images.
3. **Folders are created dynamically** in Google Drive:
    - Root folder: Provided by manager
    - Subfolders: Company-specific
4. **Uploads assets** into corresponding subfolders.
5. **(Planned)**: Trigger via Logic App when URL is added to Blob or CSV

## üîê Credentials

- For testing: uses local `credentials.json` with OAuth consent popup.
- For deployment: replace with **Google Cloud Service Account** credentials and grant access to manager's Drive.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do **NOT** upload `credentials.json` to GitHub. Add it to `.gitignore`.
